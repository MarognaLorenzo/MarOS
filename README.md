# My Rust OS

This is a simple Operating System (OS) written in Rust, created as a learning project by following an [online blog](https://os.phil-opp.com/). The goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of operating system concepts and low-level programming in Rust.

## Features

- **Kernel:** The OS includes a minimal kernel that manages system resources and executes basic functions.
- **Customization** I personally added some functionality for the cursor managment in order to make the writing easier for the user
- QEMU virtual machine is instanciated every time the OS is runned
